# NeMo Cookbook

> [!IMPORTANT]
> NeMo Cookbook is under active development

NeMo Cookbook is an example template for Generative AI with [NVIDIA NeMo 2.0](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo-framework/user-guide/latest/overview.html).

NVIDA NeMo is an accelerated end-to-end platform that is flexible and production ready. NeMo is comprised of several component frameworks which enable teams to build, customize, and deploy Generative AI solutions for:

- large language models
- vision language models
- video models
- speech models

## Focus

NeMo Cookbook is inspired by [`NeMo tutorials`](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo-framework/user-guide/latest/nemotoolkit/starthere/tutorials.html).

### Additional Concepts

- Code profiling
- Logging training and tuning runs with [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/site)
- Model alignment with [NeMo Aligner](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Aligner)
- Model output control with [NeMo Guardrails](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Guardrails)

## Models

We will use NVIDIA, Meta, and Apple models including, but not limited to:

- NVIDIA Llama variants, Mistral variants, Megatron distillations, and Minitron
- NVIDIA embedding, reranking, and retrieval models
- NVIDIA Cosmos tokenizers
- NeMo compatible Meta Llama variants
- Apple Llava variants
